## Part 2

In the space below:
* either embed or link a completed ERD for your approved P2 idea
* if there are any changes/additions to your user stories, place your full set of revised user stories here
* either embed or link wireframes for every page of your app

----------------------------------------------------------
### ERD

----------------------------------------------------------
### User Stories
  - User will get a description of what the app does, which is an app for dogs only...sorry humans.
  - The app is Tinder for dogs. Is your dog sad? Does he/she seems depressed lately? Well maybe your dog needs a companion. Doggy Tinder is here to spread doggy love across the world
  - User will be able to create their dog an account with their name, picture, and brief description if you want. User will also have to create a password to gain access.
  - User will be able to use CRUD with their account to update it.
  - Once account is created user will see different dogs and either swipe right or swipe left for different dogs that they like.
  - The dogs that the user likes will be saved. 
  - It's a dog eat dog world out here, but I believe dogs need love too.
